~Client/Server Interaction~
    Client -> Server
    Client <- Server

    Clients are devices that are being used to connect to a server.
    Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps.

    The client sends an HTTP request to the server asking for a copy of the site
    , and the server sends a response. This is done over TCP/IP. The site is broken
    down into packets and then sent over the network to the client.
