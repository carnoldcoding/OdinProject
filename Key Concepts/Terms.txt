~DOM~
    The Document Object Model is a tree structure of objects. The objects being
    tags in HTML <div /> <nav />, etc. These objects are nodes that interact with
    each other keeping in mind the restrictions of their position on the DOM.

~DNS~
    A Domain Naming System Server is a map of IP addresses and Domain Names. Like
    an address book.

~HTTP~
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a set of rules that define a language with which
    clients speak to servers.

~TCP/IP~
    Transmission Control Protocol, Internet Protocol, are rules that determine how data
    is transferred across the web.

~Packets~
    Small chunks of data that are easily routed and rerouted between the server
    and client. Data is sent this way to avoid potential corruption/crashing with
    huge chunks of data. Huge chunks of data are harder to reroute, and would cause
    congestion in the network.

~ISP~
    Internet Service Provider, allows access to the internet.

~Router~
    Routers are small computers that simply ensure the HTTP request sent from 
    the client reach the correct server.

~Modem~
    (I don't really understand this)
    Modems transfer client data into data parseable by the telephone infrastructure,
    and vice versa.
