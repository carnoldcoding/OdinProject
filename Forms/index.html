        <!-- The action attribute on a form takes a url value which dictates where to send
        the data to be processed.-->

        <!-- The method attribute tells the browser which HTTP the browser should use
        when submitting the form.

        GET and POST are the two most common forms currently used. Where GET is used to
        retrieve data from a server, and POST is used to alter data in the server.

        <!-- Form Controls are used to allow the user to interact with the form element.
        These can be text boxes, buttons, checkmarks, almost anything. 
    
        Labels are used in conjunction with form controls to let users know what
        they're supposed to do in each form. The 'for' attribute uses the id of the 
        form control it belongs to. 
        
        Submit buttons are special buttons that submit the data from the form
        they are contained within.

        Reset buttons are also special, and they reset all information placed into
        the form that encloses them.
